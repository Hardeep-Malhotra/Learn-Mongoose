# FindById Method in Mongoose

The findById() method in Mongoose is one of the most commonly used methods for retrieving a document by its unique identifier (_id) in a MongoDB collection. This article will cover everything we need to know about how to use the findById() method, including syntax, examples, installation, and troubleshooting.

## What is the findById() Method in Mongoose?

In Mongoose, findById() is a method used to retrieve a single document by its _id field. This is the primary method to query documents using the unique identifier, typically the _id field, which is automatically generated by MongoDB for each document. This method allows for a simplified querying process, making it easy to retrieve a document based on its _id, ensuring a more efficient and streamlined data retrieval process in our Node.js applications.

### Syntax:
Model.findById(id,[projection],[options])

### Parameters:
**Model:** This is the name of the collection used to retrieve the document corresponding to the provided ID.

**id:** This is the identifier for the document you intend to locate.

**projection**: projection or query projection specifies the document fields to include or exclude.

**options:** specifies additional operations e.g., lean, populate etc.

**callback:** findById also accepts a callback function, which can 
manage errors or perform actions with the retrieved document.

## How to Use findById() in Mongoose
The findById() method is very straightforward and can be used to retrieve a document by its _id. Here's how you can use it in your Node.js application.


## Common Use Cases for findById()
The findById() method is commonly used in scenarios where you need to fetch a single document by its unique identifier. Some of the typical use cases include:

**User Authentication:** Retrieving user data by their _id after successful login.

**Document Retrieval in APIs:** Fetching individual items from a database based on their unique identifier.

**Admin Access:** Allowing admin users to retrieve or modify a document (e.g., user profiles, blog posts) based on the document’s _id.


## Handling Errors and Promises
The findById() method can be used with callbacks or promises. When using Promises, we can handle success and failure scenarios more easily with then() and catch() or async/await.


## Conclusion
The findById() method in Mongoose is a simple yet powerful function to retrieve a document based on its _id field. It offers a clean and efficient way to query MongoDB by utilizing the unique identifiers that MongoDB automatically generates. With support for Promises and async/await, you can integrate this method into modern JavaScript applications seamlessly. Whether you’re building user authentication systems or fetching items in an API, findById() is an essential tool for handling data retrieval in Mongoose

### Example using Promises and using Async/Await
```js
** using Promises

User.findById(id)
  .then(user => {
    console.log('User found:', user);
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error('Error:', err);
  });


** using Async/Await

const getUser = async (id) => {
  try {
    const user = await User.findById(id);
    console.log('User found:', user);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error:', err);
  }
};

getUser('5ebadc45a99bde77b2efb20e');
